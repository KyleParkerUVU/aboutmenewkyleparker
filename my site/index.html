code from any other source, providing source code to another student,

Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I really enjoyed writing this program, but had trouble with blah blah blah.  

I really enjoyed writing this program but I had trouble at the begining opening the file on the internet. It took a lot of time, several hours, to figure it out. 
Once I got it opened and up and running it was really fun and almost like a puzzle. Finding out how to do things was a pain online so I reached out to some of my neighbors
who code in html to ask for advice etc and it went smoothly. This project got easier and easier the more time I spent on it and I believe it was a really good project to start on.
I will say it was a little overwhelming at first trying to figure out what to do since its all a foreign concept to me.

            <h2>My personal interests</h2>
            <p>The first time I'm passionate about is fitness. Fitness has been my passion since I learned about it. At a
                young age I grew up very active, such as a kid is, I later in life got lazy and addicted to video games.
                This caused me to lower my activity levels as well as gain a lot of weight. I got as high as 240lbs when
                I was 16 and was majorly depressed. Workinig out and fittness
                was the thing that saved me and helped me relieve a lot of stress as well as lose a lot of weight.
            </p>
            <p>The second thing I am passionate about is gaming. Although it has many drawbacks, I've always loved it.
                I got into the game League of Legends when I was 12 and became addicted for the next few years. I had
                the desire to go pro and was putting in 12 hours a day to achieve that dream. I reached a point where
                I was receiving scholarships for gaming in Missouri, but I was too young to tour the campus alone
            </p>
            <p>The third thing I am passionate about is music. I love going to concerts and went to a total of 20 last
                year.
                My interest for music and concerts sprouted from my friend Logan who invited me to my first in October
                2023.
                It was a artist that I never heard of prior to the concert but it was a core memory that will last
                foreveer.
